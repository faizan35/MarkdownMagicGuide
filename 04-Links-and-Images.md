# Links and Images

Markdown provides straightforward syntax for including links and images in your documents. Let's explore how to create inline links, hyperlinks with titles, and embed images.

## 1. Inline Links

To create an inline link, enclose the link text in square brackets (`[]`) and the URL in parentheses (`()`).

Example:

- [Visit our website](http://www.example.com): `\ [Visit our website](http://www.example.com) \`

## 2. Hyperlinks with Titles

Add a title to a link by including the title in double quotes after the URL.

Example:

- [Link with Title](http://www.example.com "Title"): `\ [Link with Title](http://www.example.com "Title") \`

## 3. Images and Alt Text

Embed images by using an exclamation mark (`!`) before the square brackets. Include alt text in square brackets.

Example:

- ![Alt Text](image.jpg): `\ ![Alt Text](image.jpg) \`

Remember to escape backticks within code blocks by replacing them with a backslash (`\`) to ensure proper rendering.

These simple syntax rules make it easy to include links and images in your Markdown documents. Customize them to enhance the visual appeal of your content!
