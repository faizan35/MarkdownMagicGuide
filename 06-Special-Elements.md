# Special Elements

Markdown offers special elements that allow you to add unique features to your documents. Let's explore these special elements:

## 1. Horizontal Rule

Create a horizontal rule by placing three hyphens (`---`), three underscores (`___`), or three asterisks (`***`) on a line by themselves.

Example:

- Horizontal Rule: `\ --- \`

## 2. Blockquotes

Use a greater-than symbol (`>`) followed by a space to create blockquotes.

Example:

- Blockquote:
  > This is a blockquote.
  - `\ > This is a blockquote. \`

## 3. Line Breaks

Insert a line break by ending a line with two or more spaces.

Example:

- Line Break: `This line  ` `breaks here.`

Remember to escape backticks within code blocks by replacing them with a backslash (`\`) to ensure proper rendering.

These special elements provide additional formatting options to make your Markdown documents more expressive and visually appealing. Customize them based on your content and preferences!
