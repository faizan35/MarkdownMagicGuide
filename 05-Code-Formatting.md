# Code Formatting

Markdown allows you to incorporate code snippets seamlessly into your documents. Let's explore the various options for code formatting.

## 1. Inline Code

Format inline code by wrapping the code with backticks.

Example:

- Inline code: `` `code` ``

## 2. Code Blocks

Create code blocks by wrapping the code with triple backticks. Specify the programming language for syntax highlighting.

Example:

- Code block without language specified:

  ```plaintext
  Code block content
  ```

  - \```plaintext
    Code block content
    \```

- Code block with language specified (e.g., Python):
  ```python
  def example():
      print("Hello, Markdown!")
  ```
  - \```python
    def example():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
    \```

## 3. Syntax Highlighting

Specify the programming language after the opening triple backticks for syntax highlighting.

Example:

- Python code with syntax highlighting:
  ```python
  def example():
      print("Hello, Markdown!")
  ```
  - \```python
    def example():
    print("Hello, Markdown!")
    \```

Remember to escape backticks within code blocks by replacing them with a backslash (`\`) to ensure proper rendering.

These code formatting options make it easy to showcase code snippets and enhance the readability of your Markdown documents. Customize them to suit your specific programming languages and preferences!
