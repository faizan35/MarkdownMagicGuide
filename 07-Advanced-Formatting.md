# Advanced Formatting

Markdown offers advanced formatting options for users who want to go beyond the basics. Let's explore some advanced formatting features:

## 1. Footnotes

Create footnotes by using square brackets with a caret (`[^]`) and defining the footnote text elsewhere in the document.

Example:

- This is some text with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: The footnote text.

- `\ This is some text with a footnote[^1]. \`
- `\ [^1]: The footnote text. \`

## 2. Superscript and Subscript

Use the caret (`^`) for superscript and tilde (`~`) for subscript.

Example:

- H^2^O is water. C~6~H~12~O~6~ is glucose.
  - `\ H^2^O is water. C~6~H~12~O~6~ is glucose. \`

These advanced formatting options provide additional flexibility for creating specialized content in Markdown. Experiment and use them as needed!
