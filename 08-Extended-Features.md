# Extended Features

Markdown includes additional features that offer more flexibility and enhance the overall presentation of your content. Let's explore these extended features:

## 1. Inline Links without URLs

Show the link URL on hover without embedding it in the text by using angle brackets (`<>`).

Example:

- This is a [link](http://www.example.com) without displaying the URL.
  - `\ This is a [link](<http://www.example.com>) without displaying the URL. \`

## 2. Abbreviations

Define abbreviations using square brackets with a caret (`[^]`) and provide the full form elsewhere in the document.

Example:

- The HTML[^1^] abbreviation stands for HyperText Markup Language.

[^1^]: HyperText Markup Language

- `\ The HTML[^1^] abbreviation stands for HyperText Markup Language. \`
- `\ [^1^]: HyperText Markup Language \`

## 3. Automatic Links

Simply paste a URL or email address to automatically create a link.

Example:

- http://www.example.com
- email@example.com
  - `\ http://www.example.com \`
  - `\ email@example.com \`

Remember to escape backticks within code blocks by replacing them with a backslash (`\`) to ensure proper rendering.

These extended features provide additional options for creating dynamic and interactive content in Markdown. Use them to add richness to your documents!
